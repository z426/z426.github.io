<p>Art and artist exist regardless of whether they are seen by an audience. &#128154;</p>

<p> As Phyllida Barlow said:  </p>
<blockquote>
<i>
There are plenty of artists who don't have exhibitions. There is plenty of art that's never seen. And I think I am intrigued by that. Making work that does not have a destination has its loneliness and  its sadness about it. And many artists endure that for their entire lives, and its heroic.

<p>The novel that never gets published, should it never have been written? Of course it should be. It's making a fantastic contribution to culture of the moment because that individual has that huge urge to do that without any other qualifying pressures.</p>

<p>There is a lot about the art world and the way we experience art that's fantastic, but i think there is a lot that's not entirely spoken about or recognized, which is the unseen and the unkown and the creative act as a deeply private experience.</p>

<p>There is this great, powerful desire to just create something. And does that just get eroded away ? I hope not. &#128578;</p>
