I sit in my room near window, clouds waft by dreamily, a coconut tree waves in a slow, sensual dance no human could execute, the lazily undulating landscape is visible through a curtain of light drizzle, and a vast expanse of never-ending sky spreads over the horizon.

How can it not inspire me to philosophize ?

As the clouds float away with all my worldly cares, the giddily-dancing trees fan new desires and imagination, a fresh cool breeze blows away the cobwebs of my mind and refreshes me. All I want to do is stay mesmerized, stay connected, and get absorbed till I am nothing but an extension of the beauty around. As Paulo Coelho has said <i>“Beauty is the greatest seducer of men.”</i>

And in a matter of moment I was overwhelmed, trying to hold on to all the beauty around me, contemplating how fortunate I am to be able to introduce myself to a newer of myself. This feeling of freedom was like leaving home for the first time to discover the world on your own, knowing full well that you and only you alone can shape up your path, and the stretch of world is waiting for you.

Interestingly, on the left periphery of my vision is a lush green tree with flowers dipping and fluttering gracefully with the breeze, and on the right is one with dry leafless branches, but still upright, dignified and displaying a kind of stark beauty. 

To me this tree is a testament to the many shades of life and how each shades of life can have a beauty of its own, so long as we accept life. There will be hours filled with fun, others with unhappiness ; times when we will be thrilled, others when depression will takeover us. 

The empty pockets will allow a greater sense of wealth in you. You will travel a journey with your only beating heart who will become your brand new friend. You will learn to manage all on your own. And slowly you will see how an unmatured and tender seeds turns itself into a mature and become strong that no amount of force can shake them up. You learned to learn. Thereafter, you have boarded a journey <rw-custom-highlight-text> <i> "from innocence to experience". </i> </rw-custom-highlight-text>

As I move a bit closer to the edge of my window, a couple of buildings on either side disturb my vision, so I narrow my gaze to block these out and focus on the beauty laid out before me, as it for my "sole pleasure". 

Once I leave this place, I know I will carry back the scene in my mind and in my heart, for me to draw upon and get absorbed in for a sense of tranquility, healing and happiness.

Here, I will leave you with alluring verse of Wordworth's from Daffodils -

<blockquote>
For oft, when on my couch I lie <br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,  <br>
They flash upon that inward eye  <br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;  <br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,  <br>
And dances with the daffodils.
</blockquote>
