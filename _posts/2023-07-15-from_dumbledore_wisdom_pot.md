As we know, we are not born with fear of emotions. An infant does not know what fear is. As he starts to grow he slowly develops this feeling. <br>

<!-- As Dumbledore puts it: <i> <b>Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.</b></i> -->

In <i>"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"</i>, while discussing the fate of the Sorcererâ€™s Stone with Harry in the Hospital Wing, Dumbledore encourages Harry to use dark lord's name and quotes it "<i> <b>Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself."</b></i>

Fear limits us. If we don't handle our fear it takes enormous giant shape. Fear is nothing but a thought and when emotions are put into it, it starts to control you. Once you comprehend the void, shallow, and volatile nature of fear, you will discover your strength. 

In physics, we have studied frames of reference. Try to implement it in life as well. Try to become an observer between your emotions and your fearful thoughts. Separate these two because  <rw-custom-highlight-text> <i>your fear is not you. </i> </rw-custom-highlight-text> <br>

I will leave you with this quote to ponder: <i>"The fears which you don't face, becomes your limits." </i> <br> <br> And you don't want to limit yourself, do you? &#128578;
