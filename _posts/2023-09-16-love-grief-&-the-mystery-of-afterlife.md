Hey grief, have you wondered where do they go ? <br>
At what places they go ? <br>
How does that afterlife place look like ? <br>
Is it so peaceful there, <br>
That they don't wanna return here ? <br>
What is it, grief ? 

Are they angry with us ? <br>
Why don't they speak out ? <br>
Or send any signal to us ? <br>
Is it like they are sending, <br>
But we are unable to receive it ? <br>
What is it, grief? 

How long do we have to wait? <br>
5 seconds ? 5 minutes ? 5 days ? <br>
5 months ? 5 years ? <br>
Or forever ? 

We are in the 21st century, Grief. <br>
There is so much connectivity around. <br>
Mobile, Instant messages, Snapchat, <br>
Audio Call, Video call,  <br>
And even Meta World too. <br>
But still no connectivity with afterlife ? <br>
Why, grief ?

In which dimensions are they ? <br>
If they can't come to us, <br>
Can't we go there ? <br>
You & me grief, together? 

Why don't they call us anymore? <br>
No messages, No letters, Nothing. <br>
The phone never rings with that same voice. <br>
Why is it, Grief ?

Are they angry with me ? <br>
I should be angrier, right?  <br>
I keep waiting and waiting and waiting <br> 
And they are not responding to anything.  

When the time comes and when I go there too,<br>
Will they be there ? <br>
Waiting for me,  <br>
Like I am waiting for them to come ?

Is there any hope of meeting them there ?  <br>
Or there they will also leave me ? <br>
And will be gone to some other places ?

Am I that bad ? <br>
They don't wanna see me ever ? <br>
Am I that bad person, grief? 

At least they can talk to me  <br>
On the day they brought me to the world - on my birthday ? <br>
No ? Okay, dont even talk ! <br>
Give me their address, <br>
I will visit them.

Grief, why this silence is full of agonizing scream ? <br>
The heart which feels heavier than rock. <br>
Numb body, Lumps in throat, <br>
Neither able to sallow nor disgorge it ! 

Are we just going to live  <br>
with this agony forever? <br>
That's it, Grief?  <br>

Who will answer to my bewilderness 'whys' ?

Slowly, all of them are going. <br>
But not telling us where? 

What's this mystery about the afterlife, Grief ? <br>


As I wait for the universe to answer - <i>The mystery of afterlife. </i>  <br>
I console myself for  <br>
their physical non-existence. <br>
A sudden heavy, strong waves of memory comes <br>
And hit me with full force, <br>
Right in my heart.

A gut wrenching pain,  <br>
Makes me more desperate for their love, <br>
Just need to meet them once, <br>
See them, touch them,  <br>
Or at least listen to them !

I, A 30 year old child <br>
have nothing to offer  <br>
Except the tears of mine <br>
For the love we shared, <br>
While you were here, together! ❣️
