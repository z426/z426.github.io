I sit under the tree <br>
My eyes look at fall, <br>
My heart craves for spring <br>
But I must live through winter <br>

I look at the shrubs <br>
My heart craves for flowers <br>
To enjoy its beauty <br>
I must wait for buds to bloom <br>

I look at the crescent moon <br>
My heart craves for the full moon <br>
To relish the moonlit night <br>
I must go through the new moon phase <br>

I look at the path ahead <br>
My heart craves for a destination <br>
To reach there <br>
I must take the journey <br>
